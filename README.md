   cd note_taking_app/src
   ```

## Usage
1. **Usage.md**: [Click](./Usage.md) to see how to run the application

2. **Run the Application**:
   To run the application, execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   (Use `python3` instead of `python` on macOS and Linux if required.)

3. **Follow the Prompts**:
   The application will present a menu with options to add, view, edit, and delete notes. Follow the prompts to interact with the application.

## Understanding the Code
The application consists of several modules:
- **`main.py`**: This is the main entry point for the application. It contains the main loop that handles user input and invokes functions from the other modules.
- **`notes_manager.py`**: This module handles all operations related to notes, such as loading, saving, adding, editing, and deleting notes.
- **`user_interface.py`**: This module is responsible for displaying the menu and handling user interactions.

### Code Explanation
- Each function in the `notes_manager.py` file is designed to perform a specific task. Students should implement the logic inside these functions to manage notes effectively.
- The user interface is designed to be user-friendly, guiding users through their options.

## Submission
1. **Complete Your Code**: Ensure that all functions in `notes_manager.py` are implemented and that your application works as expected.
2. **Create an text file**: Ensure you have created `explanation.txt` inside your project repository, detailing all functions in `notes_manager.py` and explaining how they work.
3. **Create a Zip File**: Once you are done, create a zip file of your project folder.
4. **Submit the Zip File**: Upload the `note_taking_app.zip` file to the designated submission portal.

Happy coding!
